        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: October 17, 2025</p>

        <h2>Agreement to Terms</h2>
        <p>By accessing and using Free PDF Merger ("the Service"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use the Service.</p>

        <h2>Description of Service</h2>
        <p>Free PDF Merger is a free, web-based tool that allows users to merge two PDF files directly in their web browser. The Service operates entirely client-side, meaning all file processing occurs locally on the user's device without any server upload or storage.</p>

        <h2>Use of Service</h2>
        <p>You may use this Service for lawful purposes only. You agree not to use the Service:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To merge documents containing illegal, harmful, or offensive content</li>
            <li>To violate any applicable laws or regulations</li>
            <li>To infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others</li>
            <li>To merge copyrighted materials without proper authorization</li>
            <li>In any way that could damage, disable, or impair the Service</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>User Responsibility</h2>
        <p>You are solely responsible for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The content of any PDF files you choose to merge</li>
            <li>Ensuring you have the legal right to process and merge the documents</li>
            <li>Complying with all applicable copyright and intellectual property laws</li>
            <li>The security and backup of your files</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>No Warranties</h2>
        <p>The Service is provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including but not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose</li>
            <li>That the Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, or secure</li>
            <li>That defects will be corrected</li>
            <li>The accuracy or reliability of results obtained from the Service</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, Free PDF Merger and its operators shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages resulting from:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your use or inability to use the Service</li>
            <li>Any errors, mistakes, or inaccuracies in the merged PDF files</li>
            <li>Loss of data or corrupted files</li>
            <li>Unauthorized access to your device or files</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>The Service, including its design, code, and functionality, is owned by Free PDF Merger and is protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws. You may not copy, modify, distribute, or reverse engineer any part of the Service.</p>
        <p>The Service uses the open-source PDF-lib library, which is licensed under the MIT License.</p>

        <h2>Privacy</h2>
        <p>Your use of the Service is also governed by our Privacy Policy. Please review our Privacy Policy to understand how we handle data (spoiler: we don't collect any).</p>

        <h2>No Data Storage or Recovery</h2>
        <p>Since all processing happens locally in your browser and no files are uploaded to our servers, we cannot recover, retrieve, or provide backup copies of your files. You are solely responsible for maintaining backups of your original documents.</p>

        <h2>Browser Compatibility</h2>
        <p>The Service requires a modern web browser with JavaScript enabled. We do not guarantee compatibility with all browsers or devices, though we strive for broad compatibility.</p>

        <h2>Modifications to Service</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Service at any time without notice. We shall not be liable to you or any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Service.</p>

        <h2>Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>We may update these Terms of Service from time to time. Continued use of the Service after changes constitutes acceptance of the modified terms. We will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page when changes are made.</p>

        <h2>Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Service operator is located, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>

        <h2>Severability</h2>
        <p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.</p>
